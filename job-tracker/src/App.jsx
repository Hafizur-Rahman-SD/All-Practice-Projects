/**

 * This is the main React component of the Job Application Tracker.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Manages the list of job applications with a `jobs` state.
 * - Allows adding new jobs through the JobForm component.
 * - Allows deleting jobs through the JobList component.
 * - Uses a `currentFilter` state to filter jobs by status (e.g., "all", "applied", "rejected").
 * - Displays filtered jobs dynamically based on the selected filter.
 * - Connects three child components: FilterBar (to change filters), JobForm (to add jobs), and JobList (to display and delete jobs).
 * 
 * The code uses React hooks (`useState`) for state management and organizes components in a simple, clean structure.
